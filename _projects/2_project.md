For a cylinder to be a viable test mass in a short range interaction measurement, we need the ability to align it with the source mass. Capacitance can be used as a non-contact method to align a cylindrical test mass with a planar source mass.

Experimental data can be mapped to simulated data to extract the initial separation and angle between a plane and a cylinder.
