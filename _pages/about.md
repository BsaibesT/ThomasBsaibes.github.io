<!-- I may not know what I am doing but I am good at it. I am a human doing human things humanly.  -->
I am a physicist working with a precision measurement group developing experiments to measure short range interactions. I have been involved in deveopling a mechanical measurements probing interactions in the submicron regime. I have also been involved in the inital stages in development of an experiment in which a gravitational interaction is used to induce a $$\Pi$$-pulse in a quantum dot.
