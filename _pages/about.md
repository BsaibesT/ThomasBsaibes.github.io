<!-- I may not know what I am doing but I am good at it. I am a human doing human things humanly.  -->
I am a drummer who tries to know something about physics. I earned my PhD. - not in drums - but in physics in 2023. As a PhD candidate at Purdue Indianapolis, I worked in a precision measurement group focused on detecting deviations from Newton’s second law of gravitation between objects at submicron separations. I successfully defended my thesis in 2023 and continue to look for new ways to make contributions to interesting problems.


<!-- I am a physicist who recently completed a 1-year SMART Scholarship service commitment at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) as a geodetic surveyor. During my time there, I carried out gravitational surveys and engaged with companies developing quantum based absolute gravimeters. Prior to the NGA, I was a physics PhD candidate at Purdue Indianapolis. His research focused on detecting deviations from Newton’s second law of gravitation for objects at submicron separations. I successfully defended my thesis in 2023 and continue to look for new ways to make contributions to interesting problems. -->

<!-- I am a physicist working with a precision measurement group developing experiments to measure short range interactions. I have been involved in developing a mechanical measurements probing interactions in the submicron regime. I have also been involved in the initial stages of development for an experiment in which a gravitational interaction is used to induce a $$\Pi$$-pulse in a nanosphere. -->
