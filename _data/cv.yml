        - title: Graduate Researcher
          contents:
            - Developed system to measure theorized fifth forces.
            - System is sensitive to Yukawa-like interactions.
            - Enhanced sensitiviy over older studies by an order of magnitude.
            - Mentored undergraduate reseachers.
        - title: Graduate Teaching Assistant
          contents:
            - Led physics recitation courses.
            - Presented problems and problem solving techniques to undergrad students.
            - Instructed undergraduate physics lab courses.
